<p> It offers undergraduate and post-graduate courses in Arts, Science, Business, Commerce or Public Policy. It has spawned several research institutions within its campus including the Blatter Herbarium, and is known for its inter-collegiate youth festival 'Malhar'. </p>
    
	<p> St. Xavier's Collegiate School was established in the year 1860 in Kolkata, India by the Jesuits (missionary priests belonging to the order of the Society of Jesus). The School comprises of two school buildings separated by an intersection; one building pertains to the Primary Section (classes Prep - 5) and the other houses the Secondary section (classes 6-12). The Secondary section shares the campus alongside the College. The school is a Catholic Institution but admits and houses students from all religious denominations, caste and creed. In fact non-Christian students make up a large segment of the school. </p>
    
    <p> 
St. Xavier's Collegiate School as it stands today is affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations that conducts ICSE and ISC Examinations for class 10 and 12 respectively. The school is also affiliated to the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education that conducts the Madhyamik Examination for class 10. Students may choose between the two boards as per their choice and preference. But in the recent years there has not been too many registrations for the Madhyamik Examination. Most students or all are opting for the Indian School Certificate Examinations in Class 10. </p>
